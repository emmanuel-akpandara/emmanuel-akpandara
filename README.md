# Hello, I'm Emmanuel üëã

I'm a curious and driven Computer Science graduate who thrives at the intersection of **data, AI**, and **software engineering**. I love building smart, scalable solutions ‚Äî from intelligent web applications to robust data pipelines ‚Äî that turn ideas into impact.

Whether it's developing full-stack systems, crafting machine learning models, or architecting cloud-native infrastructure, I enjoy the creative process of solving real-world problems through code.

##  What I Do

As a developer with a focus on **applied AI** and **software engineering**, I design and build:
- Scalable web APIs and cloud-first applications
- AI-powered features using LLMs and embeddings
- End-to-end data pipelines for analytics and automation
- Dashboards and visualizations that turn data into stories
- Systems that blend performance, functionality, and usability
